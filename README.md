# Weather Data Analysis

## Overview
This project involves the analysis of weather data to uncover meaningful insights. The data is cleaned, processed, and visualized to identify trends, seasonal patterns, correlations between weather variables, and anomalies. The goal is to improve understanding of weather behavior, inform weather forecasting, and assist decision-making in various sectors like agriculture, disaster management, and urban planning.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using statistical summaries
- Data visualizations (e.g., line graphs, bar charts, scatter plots)
- Identification of trends, patterns, and extreme weather events
- Insights for forecasting and decision-making

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebooks (optional, for interactive analysis)
